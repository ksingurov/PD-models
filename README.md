## Development of the Probability of Default model
The purpose of the exercise is to develop Probabality of Default model for a portfolio containing a large and diversified pool of customers. The process will also include testing model's predictive power and calibration precision. As a tool of development Python was choosen for its usability qualities. As developing environment Jupyter Notebook is used.

## Validation of an existing Probability of Default model
The purpose of the exercise is to validate an existing Probabily of Default model. Specifically inspect model's perfromance charachteristics such as discriminatory power and calibration accuracy.
